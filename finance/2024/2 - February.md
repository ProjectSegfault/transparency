## Previous Expenses

### Hebergnity (FIAT)

### OVH VPS (FIAT)

### DigitalOcean (FIAT)

- **Killed** - moved to Racknerd

### BuyVM (Crypto)

- **Decomissioned** - Moved to Nonic

### Soleil (FIAT)

- **Decomissioned** - Moved to a mix of IN Node and Nonic; [See here as to why we've done that.](https://blog.projectsegfau.lt/the-future-of-project-segfault/)

### Nonic (FIAT)

- **Decomissioned** - Moved to Avoro due to a non-disputable DMCA complaint.

## How we used the funds

- We paid the monthly bill of Nonic VPS.
- We transferred the projectsegfau.lt domain to Netim. And we finally have proper DNSSEC support now! More details on the future state of Project Segfault.
- We moved to Avoro due to Nonic requesting us to take down a legal proxy service in the country where the server is hosted on. There was no way of disputing this claim so we decided to move.
- **Note** that the rate that the transparency report updates will go on will be reduced as there is less donations than usual. And also due to [the reduced activity agreement announced in the blog post](https://blog.projectsegfau.lt/the-future-of-project-segfault)
- This also means a reduced activity on donations due to midou being busy with other stuff. But at the end of the month the finances should be updated at least.
