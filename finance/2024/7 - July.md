## How we used the funds

- We bought a new fan and hard drive for IN Node to have more storage to offer in our services, this should reduce the crashes and failures we have been getting for a few months now. More stability, thank you to [everyone who donated](https://wiki.projectsegfau.lt/en/Credits#donators)!
- We paid racknerd for another year for US Node.
- **Note** that the rate that the transparency report updates will go on will be reduced as there is less donations than usual. And also due to [the reduced activity agreement announced in the blog post](https://blog.projectsegfau.lt/the-future-of-project-segfault)
- This also means a reduced activity on donations due to midou being busy with other stuff. But at the end of the month the finances should be updated at least.
