## How we used the funds

- We renewed the **projectsegfau.lt** domain name and the **psf.lt** domain name. The total was 43.19 €.
- **Note** that the rate that the transparency report updates will go on will be reduced as there is less donations than usual. And also due to [the reduced activity agreement announced in the blog post](https://blog.projectsegfau.lt/the-future-of-project-segfault)
- This also means a reduced activity on donations due to midou being busy with other stuff. But at the end of the month the finances should be updated at least.
