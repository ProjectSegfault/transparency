## How we used the funds

- We paid a 6 months vps accidentally and decided to cancel the vps. The funds are in our frantech account now.
- We stopped paying for OVH after migrating to a different server from a friend I and Aryak both know.
- We paid a VPS from RackNerd costing 44,54 € per year.
- BuyVM deducted the money from the credit we have to pay the monthly bill of PIZZA-1. The credits left have been updated.
- We bought 2 spare drives (65.70 € in total) in order to [avoid getting into this situation again](https://psf.lt/blog/about-soleil-levants-downtime).
