## How we used the funds

- We paid the monthly OVH VPS bill. This will probably be the last month we will pay it
  to migrate back to Hebergnity due to it being not an extremely critical source
- We paid the monthly BuyVM bill.
- We bought an offsite backup from rsyncnet, hosted in swiss. We will start configuring our backups to there soon.
