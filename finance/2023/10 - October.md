## How we used the funds

- Arya used all the funds he got from donations to buy extra sticks of ram (+16GB I believe) to allow more headroom for in server.
- We paid the monthly bill of BuyVM, This may be the last month before we move to a different VPS (We are in the talks regarding what future reputable VPS to use instead.)
