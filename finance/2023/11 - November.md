### Hebergnity (FIAT)

## How we used the funds

- We started paying the nonic VPS and will decommission the BuyVM VPS.
- Note that the rate that the transparency report updates will go on will be reduced as there is less donations than usual. And also due to [the reduced activity agreement announced in the blog post](https://blog.projectsegfau.lt/the-future-of-project-segfault)
